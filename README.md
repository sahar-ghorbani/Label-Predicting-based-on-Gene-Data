# Label-Predicting-based-on-Gene-Data


In this report, I present the evaluation results of five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) on a given dataset. The aim of this evaluation was to assess the performance of these algorithms in terms of F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy.
